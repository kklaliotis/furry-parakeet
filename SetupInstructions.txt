You first need to make the file:

IncludePaths.txt

that lists the path for the numpy C header. The path will depend on your environment's default 

version of numpy; you can check which version of numpy is being used by default in your 

environment by typing:

python -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__file__)"

This will result in some /path/site-packages/numpy. You should copy and paste this into 

IncludePaths.txt but append /core/include/numpy/ on the end of it. Example: for Python

3.7 on OSC, this is

/apps/python/3.7-2019.10/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/

Note: some versions of numpy have the core directory as /core and some have it as /_core. Make sure

you have the correct path to the numpy C headers before proceeding.

If you want to use the Intel Math Kernel Library, set the MKL_CFLAGS and MKL_LIBS environment variables.

Finally, setup.py is configured for an older version of the setuptools package, so make sure to

pip install setuptools==56.0.0

before proceeding.


Then check your version of pip (pip --version) and do the setup:

pip install --use-feature=in-tree-build .

for pip 21.3 <= version < 23.0, or

pip install .

for pip version >= 23.0. (in-tree-build was integrated into pip as the default behavior in v23.0).

This will install pyimcom_croutines, pyimcom_lakernel, and pyimcom_interface.

If you want you can try interpolating a plane wave:

import pyimcom_lakernel
pyimcom_lakernel.testkernel(3.,[.2,.1])

To use the interface to coadd images, you can try

import pyimcom_interface

(see InterfaceInstructions.txt for a list of functions)

You can do an example by making the 'out/' directory and using the testdither.py script:

python testdither.py sample_config.txt

If you want to remove these routines, you can use:

pip uninstall furryparakeet

Comment: you can use CC=gcc to force the system to use a particular compiler. The "best" choice probably depends on your system.
